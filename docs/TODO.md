# TODO List -- Read-Only for AI Agents!

- [ ] Ensure "interaction_history.md" is verbatim copy of the chat history within Antigravity, rather than a summary.
- [ ] Redo the interfaces for EDA and weather.
- [ ] Reorganize the whole project into (1) "code", which subsumes "eda" and "weather", and (2) "docs", which subsumes "reports", and "TODO.md", and (3) "traces", which subsumes "interaction_history.md", the current implementation plans and task_list.md.
